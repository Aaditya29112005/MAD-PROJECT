# MAD-PROJECT

Welcome to MAD-PROJECT — a weather app template created with Expo.

This repository is based on a weather app template originally intended for theappmarket.io and includes basic weather features such as forecasts, hourly/daily views, and location support.

## Get started

Prerequisites

- Node.js (recommended v18+; this project worked with v22.x during development)

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the app

```bash
npx expo start
```

From the Expo dev tools you can open the app in an Android emulator, iOS simulator, or on a device using Expo Go or a development build.

You can start developing by editing files inside the `app/` directory. This project uses Expo Router for file-based routing.

## Example folder structure

```
app/
  ├── (tabs)/
  │   ├── _layout.tsx
  │   ├── location.tsx
  │   └── settings.tsx
  ├── _layout.tsx
